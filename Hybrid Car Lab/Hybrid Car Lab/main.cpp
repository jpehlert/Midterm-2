 Purpose:
 Calculate cost of a hybrid and a non-hybrid car and output which one is better based on user's preference 
 
 Inputs:
 The estimated miles driven per year
 The estimated price of a gallon of gas during the 5 years of ownership
 The initial cost of a hybrid car
 The efficiency of the hybrid car in miles per gallon
 The estimated resale value (a dollar amount) for a hybrid after 5 years
 The initial cost of a non-hybrid car
 The efficiency of the non-hybrid car in miles per gallon
 The estimated resale value (a dollar amount) for a non-hybrid after 5 years
 The user's buying criterion, either minimized gas consumption or minimized total cost
 
 Outputs:
 A label indicating whether the car is Hybrid or Non-Hybrid
 The total gallons of fuel consumed over 5 years
 The total cost of owning the car for 5 years (fuel cost + depreciation in car value)
 A statement of which car is better based on user's criterion
 
 TEST CASES:
 
 Test case 1:
 The estimated miles driven per year: 30000
 The estimated price of a gallon of gas during the 5 years of ownership: 3.50
 The initial cost of a hybrid car: 35000
 The efficiency of the hybrid car in miles per gallon: 45
 The estimated resale value (a dollar amount) for a hybrid after 5 years: 25000
 The initial cost of a non-hybrid car: 25000
 The efficiency of the non-hybrid car in miles per gallon: 20
 The estimated resale value (a dollar amount) for a non-hybrid after 5 years: 18000
 The user's buying criterion, either minimized gas consumption or minimized total cost (enter Gas or Total): Total
 For the Hybrid Car:
 The total gallons of fuel consumed over 5 years: 3333.33
 The total cost of owning the car for 5 years: 21666.67
 For the Non-Hybrid Car:
 The total gallons of fuel consumed over 5 years: 7500.00
 The total cost of owning the car for 5 years: 33250.00
 ** The HYBRID car is better than the NON-HYBRID car when Total is the user's primary objective.**
 
 Test case 2: 
 The estimated miles driven per year: -50000
 Error: you must enter an integer bigger than 0.  Please try again.
 The estimated miles driven per year: 50000
 The estimated price of a gallon of gas during the 5 years of ownership: 3.17
 The initial cost of a hybrid car: 32000

 The estimated resale value (a dollar amount) for a hybrid after 5 years: 12000
 The initial cost of a non-hybrid car: 25000
 The efficiency of the non-hybrid car in miles per gallon: 27
 The estimated resale value (a dollar amount) for a non-hybrid after 5 years: 22000
 The user's buying criterion, either minimized gas consumption or minimized total cost (enter Gas or Total): Total
 For the Hybrid Car:
 The total gallons of fuel consumed over 5 years: 4807.69
 The total cost of owning the car for 5 years: 35240.38
 For the Non-Hybrid Car:
 The total gallons of fuel consumed over 5 years: 9259.26
 The total cost of owning the car for 5 years: 32351.85
 ** The NON-HYBRID car is better than the HYBRID car when Total is the user's primary objective.**
 
 Test case 3:
 The estimated miles driven per year: 10000
 The estimated price of a gallon of gas during the 5 years of ownership: 2.50
 The initial cost of a hybrid car: 25000
 The efficiency of the hybrid car in miles per gallon: 39
 The estimated resale value (a dollar amount) for a hybrid after 5 years: 0
 Error: you must enter an integer bigger than 0.  Please try again.
 The estimated resale value (a dollar amount) for a hybrid after 5 years: 18000
 The initial cost of a non-hybrid car: -4839
 Error: you must enter an integer bigger than 0.  Please try again.
 The initial cost of a non-hybrid car: 20000
 The efficiency of the non-hybrid car in miles per gallon: 22
 The estimated resale value (a dollar amount) for a non-hybrid after 5 years: -800000
 Error: you must enter an integer bigger than 0.  Please try again.
 The estimated resale value (a dollar amount) for a non-hybrid after 5 years: 12000
 The user's buying criterion, either minimized gas consumption or minimized total cost (enter Gas or Total): Gas
 For the Hybrid Car:
 The total gallons of fuel consumed over 5 years: 1282.05
 The total cost of owning the car for 5 years: 10205.13
 For the Non-Hybrid Car:
 The total gallons of fuel consumed over 5 years: 2272.73
 The total cost of owning the car for 5 years: 13681.82
 ** The HYBRID car is better than the NON-HYBRID car when Gas is the user's primary objective.**
