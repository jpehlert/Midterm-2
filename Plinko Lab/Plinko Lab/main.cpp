 Ready to be graded
 
 Purpose: Simulate a simple game of plinko
 
 Inputs:
 Select an option based on the menu presented (0, 1, 2)
 If single chip is selected, requires the slot in which you desire to drop your chip
 If multiple chips is selected, requires number of chips wanted to drop, as well as the slot to drop all your chips in
 
 Outputs:
 For quit option:
    "Quitting game now" and then exits the program
 
 For single chip option:
    WITHOUT ERRORS:
        The path of the chip as it falls (in terms of which slot it is above)
        The winnings received for this chip
    IF AN ERROR OCCURS:
        States why the input was invalid, and immediately returns the user to the menu
 
 For multiple chip option:
    WITHOUT ERRORS:
        Reports the Total winnings
        Reports the average winnings per chip (to the nearest penny)
    IF AN ERROR OCCURS:
        States why the input was invalid, and immediately returns the user to the menu
